# ztond â€“ React To Do List

Building on the app developed in [Propulsion Bootcamp](https://github.com/kimbylr/fswd/tree/master/week7/day4). The goal is to extend the app to a useable stage, including these concepts:

* todos belong to lists ("contexts")
* contexts show amout of uncompleted todos
* 3 views: all todos, only unfinished, only finished
* rename contexts and todos
* delete/archive contexts and todos
* reorder contexts and todos

(The name is a wink at rural Swiss dialects and means "to do".)
